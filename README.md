Naive_Bayes_Classifier_From_Scratch





1. The goal of this project is to build a Naive Bayes from scratch, and use this model to identify the attitude (positive/negative) of movie reviews.



2. This project supports 4 different ways of word representation: 

    - Stemming reviews + word's frequency based on BOW

    - Non-Stemming reviews + word's frequency based on BOW

    - Stemming reviews + Binary (only keeps whether this word exists in positive or negative training reviews)

    - Non-Stemming reviews + Binary (only keeps whether this word exists in positive or negative training reviews)
